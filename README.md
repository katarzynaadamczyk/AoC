# Advent of code 2021
My solution to tasks on https://adventofcode.com/
I started solving puzzles in December 2021, to learn to write an working Python code. At beginning there were really challenging (after 9-10th puzzle). Now (2024), I find them as a good exercise for my brain. I try to optimize as much as I can, but some solutions are better when they are a simple brute-force algorithms.

# 2015
Puzzles I solved from year 2015. I solve them when I miss AoC (mostly in Novembers :) ).

# 2021
I solved puzzles from all days from advent 2021.

# 2022
Puzzles I solved in AoC ad 2022. Solution idea explanation is in each code file.

# 2023
Puzzles I solved in AoC ad 2023. Solution idea explanation is in each code file.

# 2024
Puzzles I solved in AoC ad 2024. Solution idea explanation is in each code file.
